**_Twitch Ban List Setup._**

This automates the task of banning lurker bots on Twitch. It can be used to ban any list of usernames presented to it in JSON array.
<br/>
This setup creates a command called !banbots. Upon import of the setup, you will be asked to provide a location for the JSON file. The file must contain usernames in an array.

An example file looks like this:

[<br/>
	["username1"],<br/>
	["username2"],<br/>
	.<br/>
	.<br/>
	.<br/>
	.<br/>
	["usernameN"]<br/>
]

File can have extension .txt

**_Extra moderation tools_**

Caps spam Protection, Symbol spam Protection, Emote spam Protection, "/me" Protection. Streamer, Mod, VIP and Subscriber roles are exempt, and can be changed with the filters.
